The program accesses the online platform "https://minesweeperonline.com/", and manipulating the html elements, it realizes where the given bombs are. I used selenium to access/manipulate/simlate certain elements, and kind of high level logic to figure out what is happening on the playing field. Then I thought it is high level, now not necessarily. But nonetheless, I am proud of this.

Ps.: Like every great story, this one started from a tragedy. I started writing this program out of spite, because I got a bad grate in a lab, and wanted to distract myself.
